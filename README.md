## VueJS crash course - ToDoList app
VueJs is a progressive and performant **Javascript Framework** used for building interfaces (UIs) and frontend applications.

### Why Vue?
- Makes creating UIs and frontend applications much easier.
- Less of a leraning curve than other frameworks.
- Extremely fast and lightweight.
- Build powerful SPA apps (Single Page Applications).
- Virtual DOM.
- Growing in the industry.

### Nice to know before learning Vue.
- Javascript Fundamentals (of course...).
- ES6 module syntax.
- High order array methods (forEach, map, filter).
- Arrow functions.
- Fetch API and Promises.

### What will we de doing?

We will be making a to-do app (as usual). The final look is supposed to be as following:

Where each element listed will be a separate component.

### How will we get Vue going?

We could use something like a CDN for this, but in this case we'll use Vue-CLI, which include some very useful tools:

- Includes Babel, TypeScript, ESLint, PostCSS and more.
- Includes dev server with hot reload.
- Includes Vue UI tool to manage your app in a graphical interface.

## Installation

- We'll need to install Vue-CLI, for that we'll need a decent version of Node and npm for that. So go ahead and install them.
- I would also suggest install the Vue.js devtools extension for Chrome. This will help with the component structure and much more.

Then we need to install Vue-CLI (cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html). To install it globally, using npm just use the following:

```bash
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

After this, check the version with `vue --version`.

### Using Vue

To actually create an application we can use the command line or Vue Ui. To cdreate via command line we can use:

```bash
vue create application-name
```

This will launch the wizard for a new appliocation called "application-name". Using `npm run serve` will run the application using the in-built dev server.

To do it via UI, we use the 

`vue ui` command. It will start the graphic interface in port 8000. This is basically a project manager. We can create new projects or import projects. Also see the already created projects. To serve a project using Vue UI, go to that project page, select the `Tasks` option, `Serve` and then `Run Task`. Not only it runs the application on port 8080, it also shows us different stats on the project, which is damn cool!

Once again, if you want to use the in-built server to test your project use `npm run serve`.
To build the static assets of the project use `npm run build`. These will be created in the `/dist` folder.
